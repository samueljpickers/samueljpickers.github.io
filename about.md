I am a final-year student finishing my studies in a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and a Bachelor of Mathematics, with a major in Mechatronics and a specialisation in Intelligent Systems. I am particularly interested in machine learning tools and mathematical modelling, which has heavily informed my studies and work experience thus far. [This page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samueljpickers/) contains a longer description of my profile.

This blog was created as part of an assessment piece for the *Computer Vision* course at the University of Queensland. More information about this course can be found on the [course's profile]([https://pages.github.com/](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=ELEC4630)).
