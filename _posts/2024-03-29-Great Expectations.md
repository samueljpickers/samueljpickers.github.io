# Great Expectations: Establishing Motivations for the Blog

## Prelude to the Blog

This blog will document my progress in fast.ai's *Practical Deep Learning for Coders* course. Although this course is predominantly a formative component of the University of Queensland's *Computer Vision* course, I have also undertaken it to consolidate and extend my own understanding of Deep Learning. I have previously studied other educational resources pertaining to Deep Learning, such as Francois Chollet's *Deep Learning with Python* and the University of Queensland's *Machine Learning* course, and it will hopefully be highly beneficial to get another well-detailed perspective on the fundamentals of AI. The blog titles are a bit of a nod to some of my favourite classic novels, which are relevant to their respective pages in an abstract sense.

## An Outline of My Desired Outcomes

In completing the modules of this course, I hope to cover the following major topics:

| Topic | Course Reference |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Neural Networks | Covered in sections 2, 3 and 5.  |
| Natural Language Processing  | Covered in section 4.  |
| Random Forest  | Covered in section 6.  |
| Collaborative Filtering  | Covered in section 7.  |
| Convolution  | Covered in section 8.  |
| Stable Diffusion  | Covered in section 9.  |
| Backpropagation  | Covered in section 13 and 14.  |
| Autoencoders  | Covered in section 15.  |
| Further Topics | Any other topics of interest covered in sections 10-12 and 16-25 |

The first few topics will be covered in the coming weeks, to be included in an assessment piece for my *Computer Vision* course.
