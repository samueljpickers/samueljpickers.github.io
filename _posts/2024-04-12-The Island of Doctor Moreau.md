# The Island of Doctor Moreau: Experimenting with Tools of Deep Learning

## Overview
Continuing my progress in fast.ai's *Practical Deep Learning* course, I covered the next few sections:
* **Lesson 4:** Natural Language Processing
* **Lesson 5:** From-Scratch Model
* **Lesson 6:** Random Forests

Some of topics covered in these lessons was information that I had already explored in great detail in the past (Random Forests in particular), but the course offered a quality, well-informed perspective on these topics. The *Natural Language Processing* lesson was particularly educational as my knowledge in these areas is weaker. I hope to finish Part 1 of the course in the coming weeks, and move on to the much longer Part 2.

## Learning Outcomes

Similarly to the last three lessons, there was a significant practical emphasis for each topic covered. Aside from the coverage on the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing, which gave me a good scope of how NLPs are utilised, Lesson 4 provided a great level of detail on how to use validation and test sets for training models. The considerations to how a model is built and training were expanded on in Lesson 5, in which I built a neural net and learnt some important technical details about how to approach their structure. Lesson 6 covered a topic I had done a report on in the past, and was a wonderful revisiting of some of the core concepts I learnt about random forests and their foundations. The methods of the fastcore package, such as ```fastcore.parallel```, were a particularly interesting resources that were explored in these lessons as well. Overall, lessons 4-6 provided a great level of practical detail in regards to tools of deep learning.
